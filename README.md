# Project Find-You
Group project for UCLA CS M117

If you and your friends are meeting up in a new place it can be difficult to find 
each other. No more rambling hopelessly trying to describe where you are. It 
provides a quick and effective way to visually communicate location along with
other information. All the clients will have access to a shared google map that will
contain everyoneâ€™s locations. It will allow placement of different types of markers on
the map to indicate where to go, where parking is, etc. There will also be a contacts 
list to invite friends to an event/group.
